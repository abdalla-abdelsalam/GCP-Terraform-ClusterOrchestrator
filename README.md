## Description üßê

This project is focused on the creation of a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure using Terraform. The infrastructure encompasses various components, including service accounts, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, firewall rules, a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway, virtual machines (VMs), a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) standard cluster, and an Artifact Registry repository. Additionally, the project deploys a MongoDB replica set spanning three zones, containerizes and deploys a Node.js web application that connects to the replica set, and exposes the web application using a load balancer.

## Technologies Used

We've utilized a wide range of technologies to develop this project, including:

* terraform
* nodejs
* express framework
* docker
* GCP
* bash
* k8s

## Infrastructure Components

### Service Accounts

The project includes two service accounts with an arbitrary number of associated roles. These service accounts are used to manage access control and permissions for various GCP resources.

### Network

* VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud is set up to provide network isolation for the project's components.
* 2 Subnets: Two subnets are created within the VPC to segregate the network resources.
* Firewall Rules: The project defines multiple firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
* NAT: A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is established to allow the management VM to access the internet while keeping the GKE cluster isolated.

### Compute

* Private VM: A single private virtual machine is provisioned, accessible only through the NAT gateway. This VM serves as a management instance for cluster operations, image pushing, and Artifact Registry interactions.
* GKE Standard Cluster: A GKE standard cluster spanning three zones is deployed. The GKE cluster is set to be private, ensuring it does not have direct internet access. It will be used to run containerized applications, including the Node.js web app and the MongoDB replica set.

### Storage

* Artifact Registry Repository: An Artifact Registry repository is created to store container images. All images deployed within the project are required to be stored in this repository.

## Access Control and Connectivity

* Management VM Access: Only the private management VM has access to the internet through the NAT gateway. This VM serves as the control center for cluster management and image operations.

* GKE Cluster Isolation: The GKE cluster is isolated from the internet to enhance security. It does not have direct internet access but can communicate internally within the GCP infrastructure.

* Artifact Registry Integration: All deployed container images must be stored in the Artifact Registry repository, ensuring a centralized and controlled image management process.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

To deploy this project, follow the steps below:

* Set up your Google Cloud Platform account and configure your credentials.
* Install Terraform and ensure it is configured to access your GCP account.
* Clone this project repository to your local machine.
* Modify the Terraform configuration files to suit your specific requirements, such as changing project-specific variables and credentials.

## Deploying infrastrucutre üöÄ
